# SolarSimulation

simple simulation of two dimensional solar systems

In this program, Celestial bodies are intialized with the corresponding neccesary intial conditions such as mass, position, and velocity. It then procedes in time and checks to make sure Conservation laws are being held such Energy and momentum(both linear and angular) and modifies certain values to keep these laws in check. This iterates many times.

An object called Celestial body to store related values and methods. This was used more of as a learning experience rather than a pragmatic one. I intend to rewrite the code in Python and to simplify the methods and data structures.

I used BlueJ in order to make write the program.

SystemSetup file initializes the CelestialBody object
