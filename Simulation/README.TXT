PROJECT TITLE:Solar Simulation 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Texas A&M International Universty Honors Project with Dr. Milovich
VERSION or DATE:2015
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Run SystemSetup void main function
AUTHORS:Guillermo Frausto  
USER INSTRUCTIONS:The destination asked for is the directory path with the filename attached
at the end.

This Program is a simple simulation of a two dimensional Solar System. Initializing
Celestial Bodies requires postion and velocities. With a time step, energy and momentum 
quantities are checked in order to keep conservation laws true. This is done by modifying 
the velocities of each celestial body.

This program was originally done as a learning experience and in doing so I wrote the 
program with objects which was a unnecessary complication. I intend to rewrite this code in
Python and to simplify the data structure to represent the celestial bodies.
